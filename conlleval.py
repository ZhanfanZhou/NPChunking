# this script is to evaluate a conll format file.
# "answer_no_golds_lv2.conll..." is a file from gate diff tool which has already done the evaluation
# "answer_small..." is a subset from the previous one in case that gate has visualization problem for a large file.
# so it there are 2 things remained:
# post analyse the diff tool file, and write your own evaluation instead of using gate diff tool
# Obviously neither of them are done.
